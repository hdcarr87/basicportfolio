        <p1>Hello! My name is Heather, I was born in Mesa, AZ, but have lived in Colorado my entire life.  I was raised outside of Boulder, in the small town of Niwot.  I loved growing up in a small town with quick access to Denver, Boulder, or Fort Collins.  Like most Coloradians, I love the outdoors! Hiking, fishing, camping, all of it.  My family has owned property in Red Feather Lakes for many years, and have enjoyed the beauty of the area since I was very young.

        <p2>I currently live in Arvada, CO, with my husband and 3 rescue dogs.  Axle the poodle, Benson the bassador, which is half lab and half basset hound, and Miley the Heinz 57.  We also have 2 fish tanks, and usually have 4 chickens, but are currently hen-less.  My husband Josh and I look forward to celebrating our fisrt wedding anniversary on December 31st up in Red Feather.
            </p2>

         <p3>After high school I recieved my bachelors in psychology for Creighton University.  After working for two years in property managment, I went back to school for Dental Hygiene.  I enjoyed many years of working as a dental hygienist, but decided to move into the exciting world of tech and web development.  So far I am enjoying learning as much about coding as I can! I can not wait to start my new career in web develpment.
